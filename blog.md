# Implementing GitOps for Dataiku: A Hands-On Guide

## Introduction

In the world of software development, GitOps has become a buzzword, promising streamlined deployments and enhanced collaboration.
But what does GitOps look like in action, especially for Dataiku projects?
In this article, we'll walk you through a practical Proof of Concept (POC) that demonstrates how to implement GitOps for Dataiku.
Inspired by System1's successful deployment, this guide invites you to try it yourself using shared resources.

Note: This implementation specifically demonstrates GitOps using GitHub as the platform. While GitOps principles can be implemented using other Git platforms (such as GitLab or Bitbucket), this guide focuses on GitHub-specific features like GitHub Actions for the CI/CD pipeline. The core concepts remain applicable to other platforms, though the specific implementation details may vary.

## What is GitOps?

Before diving into the POC, let's briefly touch on GitOps. At its core, GitOps uses Git as the single source of truth for managing infrastructure and application deployments.
By leveraging Git's version control capabilities, GitOps ensures that your system's desired state is always reflected in your Git repository, enabling automated deployments
and rollbacks.

## System1's Experience with GitOps

System1, a valued customer of Dataiku, has successfully implemented a GitOps workflow for their Dataiku projects. Their experience has been instrumental in shaping this POC,
providing real-world insights into the benefits and challenges of adopting GitOps.

### System1's Testimony

> _"Integrating GitOps with our Dataiku projects has significantly improved our deployment process by adding automation, consistency, and control. Using GitHub Actions and Pulumi, we built a CI/CD pipeline that automates testing, can enforce mandatory reviews, and ensures only validated changes are deployed. This approach not only strengthens access control but also provides seamless rollbacks if issues arise. Now, every change is tested and reviewed before moving from development to staging and production, which can give us confidence in our deployments, improves overall collaboration across teams and also provides more visibility, because we can see the git diff in the pull request."_  
> â€” [Attila Nagy], [Sr. DataOps Engineer] at System1

## The Proof of Concept (POC)

This POC demonstrates how to implement GitOps for Dataiku using three environments: development (dev), staging, and production (prod). The goal is to push a project from dev
to prod through a series of automated steps, with Git serving as the single source of truth to ensure consistency and reliability across environments.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing GitOps for Dataiku

### 1. Setting Up Git Remote for Dataiku DSS

In Dataiku DSS, every project is inherently a Git project. Within the "Version Control" section, you can access all the typical features of a Git repository, such as commit
history, revert options, and branch management. This is where you can set up a remote repository, which is essential for implementing GitOps.

To set up a Git remote to a GitHub project, follow these steps:

- **Navigate to Version Control**: In your Dataiku DSS project, go to the "Version Control" section.
- **Set Remote Repository**: Click on "Set Remote" and enter the URL of your GitHub repository.
- **Push Changes**: Once the remote is set, you can push your changes to the remote repository.

#### Integrating GitOps into Your Existing Workflow

As a Dataiku user, your daily workflow remains largely unchanged. You continue to develop and refine your projects within the DSS environment, leveraging its powerful tools
and features. When you're ready to promote your changes to production, simply push them to the remote repository to initiate the GitOps workflow. This approach adds deployment controls and automation without disrupting your familiar development process.

#### Transitioning to a Classic Git Workflow

Once your changes are pushed to your branch in GitHub, you enter a more traditional Git workflow. Here's how it unfolds:

- **Branch Management**: Typically, you work on a feature or fix in a dedicated branch, such as 'dev' for our POC. This allows you to isolate your
  changes and work independently from the main production code. Once your work is complete, push your changes to the corresponding branch in the remote
  repository, ensuring they are safely stored and ready for review.
- **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: With your changes in your branch, the next step is to create a PR. This PR is a request to merge your changes from the
  development branch to
  the production branch (`prod`). It acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only tested and approved changes make it to production.

### 2. Create a Pull Request (PR)

You can configure the pull request process to suit your needs, setting specific rules such as required approvers, mandatory tests, and more.
For this POC, we have added a test suite to validate that the changes are valid before allowing them to be merged. This ensures that only tested and approved
changes make it to production, maintaining the integrity and stability of your production environment.

![Create Pull Request](assets/create-pr.gif)

To illustrate the importance of automated testing in our GitOps workflow, let's look at an example where a change introduces a breaking issue. The following gif demonstrates how our CI/CD pipeline detects the problem, preventing the faulty code from being merged into the production branch. This ensures that only stable and tested code is deployed, maintaining the integrity of our production environment.

### 3. GitHub Actions for CI/CD

When a PR is created, a CI process is automatically triggered because we have set up our CI specifically for this POC. We are using a custom GitHub Action
created specifically for this purpose, which you can find [here](https://github.com/qcastel/dataiku-gitops-demo-project). Our PR
CI workflow is defined in the [pr.yml](https://github.com/qcastel/dataiku-gitops-demo-project/blob/prod/.github/workflows/pr.yml) file:

```yaml
name: Dataiku GitOps PR

on:
pull_request:
branches: - prod

jobs:
run-tests:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Dataiku GitOps Action
        uses: qcastel/dataiku-gitops-github-action@master
        with:
          python-script: "tests.py"
          dataiku_api_token_dev: ${{ secrets.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_DEV_CI_API_TOKEN }}
          dataiku_api_token_staging: ${{ secrets.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_STAGING_CI_API_TOKEN }}
          dataiku_api_token_prod: ${{ secrets.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_PROD_CI_API_TOKEN }}
          dataiku_instance_dev_url: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_DEV_URL }}
          dataiku_instance_staging_url: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_STAGING_URL }}
          dataiku_instance_prod_url: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_PROD_URL }}
          dataiku_project_key: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY }}
          dataiku_infra_id_staging: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INFRA_ID_STAGING }}
          dataiku_infra_id_prod: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INFRA_ID_PROD }}
          client_certificate: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_CERTIFICATE }}
          run_tests_only: "true"
```

The `pr.yml` file is triggered when a PR is created. It will create a bundle from the DSS Dev instance, push it to the Staging environment, and run the tests. You can find more details about the github actions [here](https://github.com/qcastel/dataiku-gitops-github-action).

To consume the GitHub Action, you will notice that we are passing it a tests script which we will detail in the next section. We also define some secrets and variables that
are used to configure the GitHub Action, those are the different urls and API keys to access the different environments.

### Dataiku GitOps GitHub Action

GitHub Actions are workflows that automate tasks within your software development lifecycle.
The Dataiku GitOps GitHub Action is a simple wrapper around the `dataiku_gitops_action.py` script.
This action automates the process of creating and managing bundles in Dataiku, ensuring a seamless transition from development to production.

An important note about GitOps implementation with Dataiku: While GitOps traditionally uses Git as the single source of truth, in this setup, the deployed bundle might not exactly match the Git repository state. This occurs because the bundle is created at a specific point in time when GitHub Actions runs, and the Dataiku state could be newer than the Git state. To address this, our implementation includes a synchronization check that:

1. Retrieves the latest commit SHA from Dataiku
2. Compares it with the GitHub repository state
3. If they don't match, triggers a Git push from the Dataiku side and restarts the process

This ensures consistency between your Git repository and Dataiku state.

```python
# Content of dataiku_gitops_action.py
def deploy(infra_id):
    """Deploy to production using bundle and deployer."""
    try:
        commit_id = get_git_sha()
        bundle_id = generate_bundle_id(commit_id)
        project = client_dev.get_project(DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY)
        project.export_bundle(bundle_id)

        # Publish the bundle to the deployer
        project.publish_bundle(bundle_id)

        # Get the deployer from the client and deploy
        deployer = client_dev.get_projectdeployer()
        deployment = deployer.create_deployment(
            deployment_id=f"deploy_{bundle_id}",
            project_key=DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY,
            infra_id=infra_id,
            bundle_id=bundle_id
        )
        update = deployment.start_update()
        update.wait_for_result()

        print(f"Successfully deployed bundle {bundle_id} to infra {infra_id}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to deploy: {str(e)}")
        raise e

def main():
    try:
        dataiku_sha = get_dataiku_latest_commit(client_dev, DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY)
        git_sha = get_git_sha()
        if dataiku_sha != git_sha:
            print(f"Dataiku commit SHA ({dataiku_sha}) doesn't match Git SHA ({git_sha})")
            sync_dataiku_to_git(client_dev, DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY)
            print("Pushed Dataiku changes to Git. Restarting process.")
            sys.exit(0)

        deploy(DATAIKU_INFRA_ID_STAGING)

        # Run tests on Staging instance
        if run_tests(PYTHON_SCRIPT, DATAIKU_INSTANCE_STAGING_URL, DATAIKU_API_TOKEN_STAGING, DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY):
            if RUN_TESTS_ONLY:
                print("Tests passed in staging. Skipping deployment to production.")
            else:
                print("Tests passed in staging. Deploying to production.")

                # Replace bundle import/export with deployment
                deploy(DATAIKU_INFRA_ID_PROD)

                # Run tests on Prod instance
                if run_tests(PYTHON_SCRIPT, DATAIKU_INSTANCE_PROD_URL, DATAIKU_API_TOKEN_PROD, DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY):
                    print("Deployment and tests successful in production.")
                else:
                    print("Tests failed in production.")
                    # Note: With this approach, rollback needs to be handled through Dataiku's deployment feature
                    sys.exit(1)
        else:
            print("Tests failed in staging.")
            sys.exit(1)
```

#### Reusing GitHub Actions

The GitHub Action used in this article is available for you to reuse and test the concept of GitOps with Dataiku. While Dataiku may not officially support this action,
it is offered under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing for contributions and modifications. This flexibility enables you to adapt the workflow to your specific needs and collaborate with others in the community.

#### Testing Framework

Each Dataiku project repository contains its own test suite in `tests.py`, while the GitHub Action serves as a shared CI component that executes these project-specific tests. This separation allows teams to define tests that are relevant to their specific project's requirements while reusing the common deployment infrastructure.

For this POC, we've implemented a simple test suite using pytest. While this is a basic example for demonstration purposes, it shows how to structure tests for a Dataiku project:

```python
import os

import pytest
import urllib3
from dataikuapi import DSSClient

# Environment variables
DATAIKU_INSTANCE_URL = os.getenv('DATAIKU_INSTANCE_URL')
DATAIKU_API_KEY = os.getenv('DATAIKU_API_KEY')
DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY = os.getenv('DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY')

# Disable warnings for unverified HTTPS requests
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

# Fixture for the Dataiku client
@pytest.fixture
def dss_client():
    return DSSClient(DATAIKU_INSTANCE_URL, DATAIKU_API_KEY, no_check_certificate=True)

# Fixture for the project
@pytest.fixture
def project(dss_client):
    return dss_client.get_project(DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY)

def test_compute_recipe(project):
    """Test that the compute_test recipe runs successfully"""
    recipe = project.get_recipe('compute_test')
    try:
        recipe.run(wait=True, no_fail=False)
        assert True
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Recipe execution failed: {e}")
```

The GitHub Action will execute these project-specific tests during the deployment process, ensuring that your project's unique requirements are met before proceeding with deployment.

#### Infrastructure Considerations

Since Dataiku often runs in private networks (intranets), accessing it from GitHub Actions runners requires careful security configuration. For secure communication, you can use mTLS with AWS Load Balancers. Starting from Dataiku 13.5, mTLS is officially supported in the SDK:

```python
import dataikuapi

# Initialize client with mTLS certificate
client_dev = dataikuapi.DSSClient(
    DATAIKU_INSTANCE_DEV_URL,
    DATAIKU_API_TOKEN_DEV,
    no_check_certificate=True,
    client_certificate=certificate_path
)
```

### 4. Merge and Deploy

Once the PR is marked as green, indicating that all tests have passed, it can be merged into the `prod` branch. This triggers the CI/CD pipeline to replay the tests and deploy the changes to the production environment.

The `release.yml` file is used for this process:

```yaml
name: Dataiku GitOps Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - prod

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Dataiku GitOps Action
        uses: qcastel/dataiku-gitops-github-action@master
        with:
          python-script: "tests.py"
          dataiku_api_token_dev: ${{ secrets.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_DEV_CI_API_TOKEN }}
          dataiku_api_token_staging: ${{ secrets.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_STAGING_CI_API_TOKEN }}
          dataiku_api_token_prod: ${{ secrets.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_PROD_CI_API_TOKEN }}
          dataiku_instance_dev_url: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_DEV_URL }}
          dataiku_instance_staging_url: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_STAGING_URL }}
          dataiku_instance_prod_url: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INSTANCE_PROD_URL }}
          dataiku_project_key: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_PROJECT_KEY }}
          dataiku_infra_id_staging: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INFRA_ID_STAGING }}
          dataiku_infra_id_prod: ${{ vars.DATAIKU_INFRA_ID_PROD }}
          client_certificate: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_CERTIFICATE }}
          run_tests_only: "false"
```

This workflow reuses the same GitHub Action, but this time it also pushes the changes to production. It's a great demonstration of how GitHub Actions are reusable across
different workflows.

![Merge Pull Request](assets/merge-pr.gif)

While we've demonstrated this process for a single project, many customers will have multiple projects to manage. To extend this approach across various projects, you can:

- Copy and paste the CI/CD configuration for each new project.
- Reuse the same GitHub Action, ensuring consistency and efficiency across your workflows.
- Customize a `tests.py` script for each project to validate that your specific project requirements are met and everything is functioning as expected.

#### Additional Tips from System1's Implementation

For organizations managing multiple Dataiku projects, System1 shared their approach to scaling the GitOps implementation efficiently. They use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Pulumi to automate the entire process:

> "Managing multiple Dataiku projects manually became challenging as we scaled. We automated our entire setup using Pulumi to manage GitHub repositories and their configurations. Our automated process discovers Dataiku resources (projects, plugins), creates corresponding GitHub repositories, and maintains all necessary settings and secrets. It even handles cleanup by removing repositories when projects are deleted. This has significantly reduced our operational overhead and potential for configuration errors."
> â€” Attila Nagy, Sr. DataOps Engineer at System1

This automation approach demonstrates how GitOps implementations can be scaled efficiently in larger organizations, though the specific tools and methods may vary based on your organization's needs and infrastructure.
